That is a question Euromonitor International asks &mdash; and answers &mdash; each year.</p><p>Researching the arrival records of more than 400 cities around the globe, the organization determines the most popular destinations on Earth. Form historic centers in Europe to up-and-coming hot spots in Asia to long-time favorites in the United States, find out which places top the 2019 ranking.&nbsp;</p><p>How many will you be adding to your bucket list?&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>50: Dublin, Ireland</h2><figure><img alt="Dublin" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/dublin/rOP895O3xUTzHgPCqjacabGpF54=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/ba/2e/ba2e6cdea8f945eab6c8e715f5a7a431.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5.5 million*</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>4.8%</p><p>It's easy to see why this city remains one of Europe's, and the world's, biggest draws. Here, you can walk along brick-lined streets and still see pubs and shops that have existed for generations, interspersed with hot new restaurants and fast-paced businesses.</p><p>This combination of old and new lends Dublin a quaintness not found in many of the cities on this list. Even in the face of a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/ireland/irish-tourism-in-2019-choppy-waters-ahead-1.3738219">4.5 percent</a> VAT increase that's affected the hospitality industry, Dublin isn't going anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><em>*Numbers reflect visitors staying a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of less than 12 months.</em></p></section><section><h2>49: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</h2><figure><img alt="Riyadh" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/riyadh/-T-9LV7oDuCqEeQn-ILTstpIlUo=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/49/6c/496c7a00df2b468382461b5f86437dd7.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5.5 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>3.5%</p><p>Euromonitor found an increased focus on tourism offerings in the Middle East, and highlighted Riyadh as a city in the region investing heavily to lure travelers.</p><p>Riyadh witnessed a decline in arrivals between 2017 and 2018 due to an exodus of oil and energy expats and rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Visa fees for pilgrims to visit Mecca and Medina also increased.</p><p>To combat the decline, the country offered a new visa to open the country to more international leisure travelers and pushed for more entertainment options, even hosting the first WWW wrestling match to help shake its image as a conservative country.&nbsp;</p><p>Healthy growth in 2019 makes it clear the efforts worked.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>48: Ha Long, Vietnam</h2><figure><img alt="Ha Long" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/ha-long/uLCy-DiJCJjdCBwyeBRcz8hlLto=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/61/fe/61fe19bf85dc43408381ee330d4a92e2.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.2 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>18%</p><p>For years, Vietnam was hidden behind a Communist cloud, which kept tourists from visiting. With new visa programs, however, it showed it was ready to welcome travelers with open arms. The result? A robust 18 percent growth in arrivals in 2019.</p><p>Ha Long, or Halong, has become especially popular with the Chinese, as it's close to the border and easy to get to for weekend jaunts and excursions. The bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site featuring <a href="http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ha-long-bay/">1,600 limestone islands</a> that jut from a green-blue sea. Plus, travelers from the west who fly into Hanoi can easily get to Ha Long by bus in less than two hours.</p></section><section><h2>47: Madrid, Spain</h2><figure><img alt="Madrid" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/madrid/i-a7tjTZ55Qj1VYRIpDrTTi5jvA=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/18/eb/18eb8cc25398478f908f282686300e90.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>2.9%</p><p>As its sister sister of Barcelona decries an influx of tourists, Madrid, Spain's largest city and capital, has remained quiet, happily accepting those who want to experience its amazing culture, food and nightlife that goes well into the wee hours.</p><p>Madrid did impose a ban earlier in 2019 to prevent Airbnb rentals to apartments and homes without private entrances, shutting down more than <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/03/27/inenglish/1553702152_849878.html">10,000 units</a>, but that change was more a safety and hospitality business alteration that had little impact on travelers.</p><p>Not only did Madrid experience minor growth this year, but Spain as a country is set to break tourism records with 83.4 million visitors, according to "The New York Times."&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>46: Venice, Italy</h2><figure><img alt="Venice" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/venice/3Bhx0mWzPKGdYacQViOIYt-A8gQ=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/9f/b3/9fb3adb226df4c6d811a65076a3575df.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>1.6%</p><p>Although Venice did experience growth in 2019, it was extremely mild for the Italian canal site, which dropped two ranking points since 2018. Venice's decline may be attributable to a travel term that's nabbed headlines in recent years: "overtourism." Even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-29/venice-s-future-is-challenged-by-climate-change-and-mass-tourism">Bloomberg</a> said in November, "Tourists ruined Venice."</p><p>The group of islands that make up Venice, connected by bridges, is just 160 square miles &mdash; pretty small for taking in 5.6 million people. The population of the city is under 300,000, meaning tourists outnumber locals to a staggering degree in the 1,200-year-old city.</p><p>What will happen to tourism in 2020 as the sinking city that is just 3 feet above sea level continues to experience massive floods?</p></section><section><h2>45: Moscow, Russia</h2><figure><img alt="Moscow" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/moscow/ey7yJU_FaplEjbxsyNcdmZsh3xU=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/7f/84/7f84a208e03d4e33a90f2b9aed08c30a.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6&nbsp;million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>8.3%</p><p>Trapped behind the Iron Curtain for more than 45 years when it was part of the Soviet Union, Russia continues to fascinate people today, drawing curious travelers who want to glimpse cities once forbidden to outsiders.</p><p>Moscow is the economic, historic and cultural center of what is today the world's largest country, attracting both leisure and business travelers, including many from China.</p><p>The city's Festival Journey to Christmas has become a wildly popular winter celebration, but Moscow is an interesting place to explore year-round and is pacing to continue to grow in arrivals in 2020.</p></section><section><h2>44: Orlando, Florida</h2><figure><img alt="Orlando" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/orlando/hDu_Vu5qlqMtCJQP1RFNi19rTKk=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/28/33/2833032eef09436595fc335dce0c4523.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5.7 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>3.1%</p><p>The Land of the Mouse, Orlando is home to the world's most popular theme park &mdash; Walt Disney World &mdash; where five Disney theme parks are all in place alongside two Universal Orlando theme parks, numerous water parks, and plenty more family fun and entertainment. Add in the fact that Orlando calls sunny Florida home, offering warm temperatures for anyone wanting a break from snow in the winter months, and it's not hard to grasp why it remains one of the most-visited cities in the United States.</p><p>But it's not all fun and games! Orlando attracts big business in the form of conferences and events, enticing companies with low prices and direct flights from multiple cities. And when workers come for business, many tack on additional days for the pleasure portion, even bringing their families in what has been coined "bleisure" travel.</p></section><section><h2>43: Athens, Greece</h2><figure><img alt="Athens" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/athens/LSvcf7-Ymkm2s2YJcGNMvg7EuKw=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/25/26/25260a546d0846c99e43eed83bf72764.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.3 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>10%</p><p><a href="https://www.farandwide.com/s/europes-most-livable-cities-71985994306c4df6">Greece</a> has witnessed a wild decade of economic tribulations following a financial and government-debt crisis that hit hardest in 2010, when the country had to ask for its first bailout. Troubles continue, yet tourism is on the rise. Part of the EU, Greek's currency is the Euro, but as the residents of the country struggle, prices on hotels, restaurants and shops have dropped. And tourists are taking advantage.</p><p>But this is a mutual benefit: Tourism is found to make up nearly <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/241056/article/ekathimerini/business/greece-is-over-reliant-on-tourism">25 percent</a> of Greece's gross domestic product. Centuries later, the place that gave birth to Western civilization remains as intriguing to travelers as ever.</p></section><section><h2>42: Cairo, Egypt</h2><figure><img alt="Cairo" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/cairo/SE0iyvaz9Q-ASh6RD0iiOssZCdI=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/40/b2/40b2d8bd380747aebf83e6bff2f65d86.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.8 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>18.3%</p><p>Egypt's tourism experienced a major slump in 2018, which the country used as a driver to improve for 2019. Euromonitor called the tourism turnaround impressive, as Cairo jumped eight places to its No. 42 ranking.</p><p>Cairo's strong investment in the restoration of its historic sites and development of current infrastructure is paying off: It is the fourth most-visited city in the Middle East and Africa region. Join the growing throngs if you want to experience an intriguing mix of chaotic big-city action and ancient landmarks like the Pyramids of Giza.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>41: Berlin, Germany</h2><figure><img alt="Berlin" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/berlin/HF6GSzPi9FuIp7EwDIuugZBKFY4=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/ea/13/ea133d68c0a241b8882054eec24fa1ae.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.2 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>4%</p><p>As French Culture Minister Jack Lang once said, "Paris is always Paris, and Berlin is never Berlin." This is due to the city's fast-paced growth and ever-changing offerings, as it continues to evolve into a major player on the global stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Few cities can match Berlin's mix of history -- dark and traumatic at many turns -- and progressive spirit, with a nightlife scene that rarely stops buzzing and a flair for bold, thought-provoking art.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>40: Cancun, Mexico</h2><figure><img alt="Cancun" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/cancun/XpXVPF2Tn-ZlB7VqDvTNqU_WnfE=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/b5/47/b5472a7a0cab4ac488d7aba378be31f9.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.2 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>1.8%</p><p>The most visited city in Mexico, Cancun is also Latin America's most-visited destination.</p><p>This beach destination on the Yucatan is perhaps best known for its posh resorts and hotels. But travelers from around the world also come to enjoy the city's nightlife, water sports, historical ruins and year-round warm weather. Tourists from the neighboring United States are particularly keen to venture to Cancun's sandy shores.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>39: Jaipur, India</h2><figure><img alt="" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/img/9086CJslhw2s4MaTUP85aXgGSyg=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/87/fc/87fc37bbac224c6f8189fb83404f757c.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>7.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>18.5%</p><p>The capital of India's Rajasthan state, Jaipur is nicknamed the "Pink City" for its pink-hued buildings, including majestic sites like City Palace (circa 1732 AD), Nahargarh Fort (circa 1734; shown) and Hawa Mahal (circa 1799). More than awash in pink, Jaipur also touts the golden Jal Mahal (circa 18th century), Albert Gall Museum (1887) and Galtaji (circa 15th century).&nbsp;</p><p>Jaipur moved up five spots in the rankings over 2018, and has increased 29 places since 2013. This is, clearly, a tourist city very much on the rise.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>38: Johor Bahru, Malysia</h2><figure><img alt="Johor Bahru" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/johor-bahru/mfcKwOiDuPfSQGfiLN55cKkZll0=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/26/f2/26f2fe407eca4a6d87bd23febe57233b.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>7.2 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>13%</p><p>Separated by Singapore by just 14 miles, Johor Bahru is quickly making a name for itself as a destination worth visiting in its own right, climbing three spots from 2018 and eight places since 2013. Johor Bahru is touted for being a cheaper version of Singapore, which continues to grow more and more popular &mdash; a game of supply and demand, so to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to exchange rates, a U.S. dollar is worth 50 cents more in Johor Bahru than in Singapore. And who doesn't love a good deal?&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>37: Vienna, Austria</h2><figure><img alt="Vienna" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/vienna/sI5IDK7W_epyYih7yJyp1Pos8DI=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/3c/09/3c09c9bd9337482884a2d0e89ae42599.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>3.5%</p><p>Though Vienna is still growing in visitors year-over-year, it's been losing some ground to destinations like Croatia, Slovenia and Sweden. According to Euromonitor, this is because travelers are desiring a "newer, more localized" experience and fewer crowds. Airlines are making it easier to visit these destinations, as well.</p><p>As a result, Vienna has slipped two spots since 2018 and eight spots since 2013. Still, 6.6 million people is a good amount of people coming to take advantage of the city's many offerings,&nbsp; which range from the historic (a.k.a <em>old</em>) Hapsburg palaces and structures to modern restaurants on the cutting edge of cuisine.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>36: Chennai, India</h2><figure><img alt="Chennai" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/chennai/b6TQez0AUbgiM9L_4IUv4RHeasg=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/38/81/3881f4cb0c1648d98f95eec7eeebf110.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>5 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>23.5%</p><p>Chennai is yet another Indian city shooting up Euromonitor's list, climbing five spots over last year. The city is located on the Bay of Bengal, which supplies miles and miles of beaches on its Coromandel Coast, the most popular of which is Marina Beach at 8.1 miles.</p><p>Cultural tourism is credited with the rise in visits, as people descend upon the 400-year-old city to experience its temples and churches. With a population of more than <a href="http://tamilnadutourism.org/places/CitiesTowns/Chennai.aspx">47 million</a> people, 5 million visitors is just a drop in the bucket for this destination referred to as the "Gateway to the South."</p></section><section><h2>35: Milan, Italy</h2><figure><img alt="Milan" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/milan/v_KNCscbm7J5DrlE7xcoWPxGGfc=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/8e/c0/8ec00a5a223b4665ba7eb7ba0a8fbd2c.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>1.9%</p><p>The northern Italian city of Milan is known as one of the world's fashion capitals. It's also a metropolis filled with business and convention travelers alongside the many leisure visitors who just want a glimpse at its iconic gothic cathedral, the Duomo di Milano.</p><p>Travel growth to Milan is slight, just 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2.1 percent in 2018, but it's there. In addition to its cathedral, the city is home to Leonardo Da Vinci's painting, "The Last Supper," which is safely preserved for viewing at Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>34: Las Vegas, Nevada</h2><figure><img alt="Las Vegas" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/las-vegas/huOoaeXzPxfRoPobbpxAKbZqKzE=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/6f/a7/6fa7b61b2e804b15a0c1352465832fe5.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>6.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>.7%</p><p>After years of head-spinning growth, Vegas tourism is slowing down a bit. Yet still, it remains a powerhouse: The majority of visitors to Las Vegas occupy hotel rooms at a 94.5 percent capacity, and the room taxes for overnight guests alone account for $282.6 million!</p><p>While new mega-resorts are fewer and farther between these days, the Strip is poised to welcome a splashy addition next year: the multi-billion-dollar, Asian-themed Resorts World Vegas. Perhaps it'll lead to more robust growth for the city in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>33: Barcelona, Spain</h2><figure><img alt="Barcelona" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/barcelona/BtSt_fx4QlluLJORMeLyjkzt-hA=/799x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/05/a5/05a586b486e142549655d6f34f47f89f.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>7 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>4.5%</p><p>In the face of an overtourism crisis, Barcelona has fully been on the attack as of late, placing restrictions on attractions and accommodations.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, the city began charging admission to Parc Guell, a World Heritage Site, in an effort to control the crowds. (It remains free for residents of the city.) In 2019, it banned Airbnb rentals to rooms that did not have a private entrance, to prevent citizens from renting out rooms and to further keep numbers down.</p><p>The efforts are working: Tourism may be up this year, but it's cooled off a bit since last year, when it grew by 6.8 percent.</p></section><section><h2>32: Denpasar, Indonesia</h2><figure><img alt="Denpasar" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/denpasar/PUqgJGAd4uzZZWpcxx3GUNfbINI=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/40/0c/400c1776c7344634add784a08115d466.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>8.6 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>19.4%</p><p>Denpasar is the hub and capital of Bali, the Indonesian island that has long been a dream trip for tourists. Even if the city isn't where the majority of the people are headed &mdash; that would be the beaches &mdash; it still manages to draw sizable crowds to experience its temples, museums, entertainment avenues and assault of colors, scents and sounds. It's a big mover and shaker on the list, rising four spots in 2019 and 13 places in 2018.</p><p>Alas, while exciting, this tourism boom has resulted in some concerns over sustainability, leading Bali to make changes to try to protect its natural assets.</p></section><section><h2>31: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</h2><figure><img alt="Ho Chi Minh City" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/ho-chi-minh-city/HM8Gkm-0QIuOCZtcPAIjoS4WfDk=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/b4/56/b4569aa62ea948c896fdf0f00b66dee1.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>8.2 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>14%</p><p>Formerly known as Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City was once off-limits to many travelers, especially those from the United States following the Vietnam War. It took nearly 10 years for the country to change its visa policy and to welcome tourism dollars, and still more time for U.S. citizens to consider it as a worthy travel destination.</p><p>These days, though, American tourists are arriving in droves as they look to learn about the war from a new perspective while experiencing staggering natural landscapes and interacting with famously friendly locals.</p></section><section><h2>30: Shanghai, China</h2><figure><img alt="Shanghai" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/shanghai/k8I2N6arYnHqIUbhVJTG4ePqmeM=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/24/1d/241d1572beec4a49be4e168dc71cc147.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>7.7 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>3.5%</p><p>Shanghai is a draw to both Chinese and international visitors. The Shanghai Municipal Tourism Administration is actively chasing larger destinations like Paris and Tokyo in an effort to become one of the most-visited cities in the world.</p><p>Besides its role as a thriving business center, the city touts the Shanghai Disney Resort, which welcomed <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2094937/shanghai-disney-hits-10-million-visitors-beating-hong-kong">10 million</a> visitors within the first year after it opened (in 2016) and continues to draw crowds.</p></section><section><h2>29: Los Angeles, California</h2><figure><img alt="Los Angeles" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/los-angeles/iD_UIm3i06mam0DGaTObpdvkfRk=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/11/ca/11ca3ca3aa624438890af69c8bbb50b6.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>7.7 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>3%</p><p>L.A. lands high on the list despite Euromonitor only accounting for the city proper. If one were to add the Greater Los Angeles area that includes parts of Orange County, San Bernardino County and Riverside County, it surely would be in an even higher position.</p><p>Still, the city itself offers plenty for tourists to love, especially following recent developments in the downtown area. Once overlooked, this neighborhood is now home to some of the region's most interesting restaurants and nightlife venues.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>28: Osaka, Japan</h2><figure><img alt="" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/img/ta4y1CqmbmraN9t4yHNnxd9hLAE=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/1e/89/1e89b21f144a447b8a69280242578921.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals: </strong>9&nbsp;million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>14.5%</p><p>Tokyo may be the more famous and most-visited of Japan's cities, but pacing not far behind is the country's "second city" of Osaka. Not only does Euromonitor record more than 14 percent growth over last year, but according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-osaka/tourism-in-osaka-often-overshadowed-by-tokyo-is-catching-up-idUSKBN1QS2TK">Reuters, </a>foreign visitors to Osaka increased five-fold between 2012 and 2017. Impressive!</p><p>With restrictions on visas lifted, the Chinese and other foreign tourists are enjoying their chance to see this charming city, and to explore the nearby Buddhist temples of Kyoto, the former capital of Japan. (It ranks No. 67 on this list.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p></section><section><h2>27: Miami, Florida</h2><figure><img alt="Miami" src="https://thumbor.granitemedia.com/miami/nbrtbvJYYtFZLylpi24zqaRAW9s=/800x0/filters:quality(80)/granite-web-prod/22/1d/221dc0dce40f4931942c9b6386a0a38d.jpeg"/></figure><p><strong>2019 Arrivals:</strong> 8.3 million</p><p><strong>Year-Over-Year Growth: </strong>2.7%</p><p>When Henry Flager took the railroad to Miami in 1896, he opened the United States to the Caribbean. Ever since, the city has remained hot as a leisure destination.</p><p>With its close proximity to the islands of the Caribbean, especially Cuba and Puerto Rico, Miami became a Latin American hub and is today the state capital. Its white-sand beaches, considered among the best in the country, pair beautifully with an exciting nightlife and live-music scene, not to mention some seriously flavorful cuisine.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only is Miami a gateway to Central and South America, but its Latin culture has made it a leading city for Hispanic business.

While Bangkok may provide streets bustling with street vendors and shops, Pattaya is a laidback destination where visitors can enjoy the sun, golf courses and luxury resorts.</p><p>This area has grown with the influx of Chinese tourists, who love the high-end shops and resorts here, such as Tiffany's.
